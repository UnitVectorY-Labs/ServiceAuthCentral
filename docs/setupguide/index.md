# Setup Guide

[ServiceAuthCentral](https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/ServiceAuthCentral) is deployed as a set of Docker containers and a static website for the [management portal](https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/serviceauthcentralweb). This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy the service. While the design of ServiceAuthCentral is modular and is intended to be extendable for deployment in a variety of environments, the initial version focuses on deployments to GCP.

!!! note
    To get up and running read the [deployment](../setupguide/deployment.md) and [configuration](../setupguide/configuration.md) guides.
